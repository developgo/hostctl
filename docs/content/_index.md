## Why?

Because it is a tedious task to handle the `hosts` file by editing manually. 
With this tool you can automate some aspects to do it cleaner and quick. 


## Features
  
  * Manage groups of host names by profile.
  
  * Enable/disable complete profiles.
  
  * add/remove groups of host names.
  
  * add profiles directly from a `.etchosts` file that you can add to your vcs.
